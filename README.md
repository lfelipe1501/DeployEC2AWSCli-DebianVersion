# DeployEC2AWSCli-DebianVersion

This repository contains a little `bash-script` to easily deploy any instance in aws ec2 using aws-cli.

## Details

This script can be used to deploy any EC2 Debian version instance in aws ec2 using aws-cli.
At the moment the script creates a t2.micro instance of the free layer and uses the Official Ubuntu AMI ID to install an up-to-date and working debian system.

This script creates a standard security group with the basic rules for web access with the ports:
* 80
* 443
* and a custom SSH port that the user sets for security.

It also creates a floating IP so that the machine is always connected to a Fixed IP.

All the resources assigned in this script are left with their own name that the script creates randomly.

> *This script does not ask for the region to deploy the instance, it assumes that you already have this configured in your aws-cli environment or if you are using cloudshell, that you are in the region where you want to deploy the new server.*

## How to use

Its use is very simple, you just need to go to the cloudshell in your aws console or configure and use aws-cli app on your favorite linux distro:

```bash
wget -qN https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lfelipe1501/DeployEC2AWSCli-DebianVersion/main/DeployAWS-DBNBase.sh && chmod +x DeployAWS-DBNBase.sh && bash DeployAWS-DBNBase.sh
```
